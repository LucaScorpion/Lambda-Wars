Lambda Wars
=============

Lambda Wars is an asteroids-like game made in Haskell, using the [Gloss graphics library](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/).
We made it for an assignment for uni, but because it worked out quite nice we decided to put it on GitHub.

###Made by:
- Dwight Peters
- Luca Scalzotto

###Running the game:
To run the game simply run "Play Lambda Wars.bat".
This is a simple batch file which will automatically build the game and copy all resources.
When that is (already) done, it will run the game.

###Controls:
Thrust: Arrow key up  
Rotate ship: Arrow keys left and right  
Shoot: Space  
Quit game: Escape

###Powerups:
The game contains several powerups, which are represented by different characters.  
The powerups (and its character):
- Plus 1 score multiplier (+)
- 5 Seconds invulnerability (I)
- Plus 1 life, max 5 (<3)
