Lambda Wars
=============

Lambda Wars is an asteroids-like game made in Haskell, using the [Gloss graphics library](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/).
We made it for an assignment for uni, but because it worked out quite nice we decided to put it on GitHub.

Made by:  
-Dwight Peters  
-Luca Scalzotto

To run the game simply run "Play Lambda Wars.bat".
This is a simple batch file which will automatically build the game and copy all resources.
When that is (already) done, it will run the game.
