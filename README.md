Lambda Wars
=============

Lambda Wars is an asteroids-like game made in Haskell, using the [Gloss graphics library](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/).
We made it for an assignment for uni, but because it worked out quite nice we decided to put it on GitHub.

###Made by:
- [Dwight Peters](https://github.com/Dwightojo)
- [Luca Scalzotto](https://github.com/LucaScorpion)

###Running the game (simple):
Make sure you have the Haskell platform installed: [download here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).  
Extract Lambda-Wars.zip, this contains the last (stable) version of the game.  
Run lambda-wars.exe, and play!  

###Running the game (latest commit):
If you have the Haskell platform and Gloss installed, run "Play Lambda Wars.bat".
This is a simple batch file which will automatically build the game and copy all resources.
Note: this builds the game from the last commit, and thus may contain bugs etc.

###Controls:
Thrust: Arrow key up  
Rotate ship: Arrow keys left and right  
Shoot: Space  
Quit game: Escape

###Powerups:
The game contains several powerups, which are represented by different characters.  
The powerups (and its character):
- Plus 1 score multiplier (+)
- 5 Seconds invulnerability (I)
- Plus 1 life, max 5 (<3)
